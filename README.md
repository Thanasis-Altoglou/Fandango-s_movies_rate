# Fandango-s_movies_rate


If you are planning on going out to see a movie, how well can you trust online reviews and ratings? Especially if the same company showing the rating also makes money by selling movie tickets. Do they have a bias towards rating movies higher than they should be rated?
## Goal:
The goal of this project is to use pandas and data visualization skills to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets based off the 538 article.
## About the dataset:
This is the data behind the story [Be Suspicious of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandango's](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) openly avalaible on 538's Github: [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data). There are two csv files, one with Fandango Stars and Displayed Ratings, and the other with aggregate data for movie ratings from other sites, like Metacritic,IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes.


`all_sites_scores.csv` contains every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating, a RT User rating, a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score, and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango. The data from Fandango was pulled on Aug. 24, 2015.

fandango_scrape.csv contains every film 538 pulled from Fandango.
